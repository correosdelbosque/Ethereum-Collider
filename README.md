# Ethereum-Collider
A simple experimental application which creates ethereum wallets as fast as possible and search for one with positive balance. It can be used also to generate a single wallet or edit in realtime the private key to get the associated public key.
It can be used to find a private key used with a bruteforce approach.
I'm not responsible for improper/illegal usage of this tool.

Instruction to build project are coming!
